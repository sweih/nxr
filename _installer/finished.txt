/b/Security//b/

We strongly recommend, that you make the installation safe by creating an 
additional Apache-Authentification for the /nx/cms folder and all subfolders!
Therefore you need to create an .htaccess and .htpasswd file. You may use a common
login for all users of the system. However N/X is considered to be safe in the final
version, this is just for making sure, that you do not run into a securtity 
problem, if there is a bug in the N/X backoffice.
