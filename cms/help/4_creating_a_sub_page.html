<p class="form_title">Creating a sub page</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="wcopy"> A typical site structure contains a homepage and sub pages that form a tree-like 
  hierachy. A homepage could be viewed as the introduction to the site, whereas 
  sub pages provide more detailed information on the topics introduced on the 
  homepage. Sub pages and folders are essential in organising the content of a 
  large site.</p>
<p class="wcopy"><b>Note:</b> After you have created your homepage, you can continue and create 
  sub pages using the same steps that were described in section 3. The only difference 
  is that you click the <b>Add Page</b> command on a lower level in the <b>Browse 
  Sitemap</b> menu <a href="help.php?topic=glossary#tree">tree</a> than 
  when creating the homepage.</p>
<ol class="wcopy">
  <li>Choose <b>Website </b>in the<b> Content </b>menu. <p>Browse Sitemap is displayed. <p>
  </li>
  <li>Click on the (+) image next to the object where you want to add a new 
    sub page.</li>
  <li> See the step-by-step instructions in section <a href="help.php?topic=3.1_creating_a_homepage"> 
Creating a homepage</a> to proceed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wcopy">Note: When creating your homepage or sub pages, remember the level you
