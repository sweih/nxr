<p class="form_title">Linking to external Web pages: Introduction </p>

<p class="wcopy">You should create links between the pages you have created, and  link them to your partners' pages. Linking to external Web pages helps your readers find your partners.</p>

<p class="wcopy"><b>Prerequisites</b>: At this stage you need to have a web page with some content, and you need to have the exact and correct URL of the page  you want to link to. </p>

<p class="wcopy"><strong>Note:</strong> You need permission to link to other companies' pages if you intend to link to them in business purposes.</p>

<ol start="1" class="wcopy">
  <li>Select <b>Content</b> on top of the N/X working 
    area. Choose <strong>Website</strong>. </li>
<br> 
   <li>Select the page you want the link to reside on. </li>
At this stage the <strong>Page editing</strong> area is displayed. 
  <br>
  <li>Choose the part of the page you want the link reside on. Usually the links 
 are in the body text. Click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon on the right.</li>
At this stage the html editor is displayed. <br>
<li>Highlight the text or image you want to choose as the link text. 
<li> Click the <b>linking button</b> <img src="button.gif" border="0">.
A linking dialog box is displayed.
  </li><br>
  <li>In the space reserved for the URL, write the whole URL address. <b>N.B.</b> 
    Check that the URL is valid and correct. 
  <li>Choose the way the link will be showed in the <b>Target</b> drop menu</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Using <b>"New Window (_blank)"</b> causes the link to open in 
      a totally new browser window, leaving the page with the refering link still 
      open behind it. </li>
    <li>Using <b>"Same Window (_self)"</b> loads the page within the 
      same frame as the link tag.</li>
    <li>Using <b>"Topmost Window (_top)"</b> within a link tag causes 
      the new page to load in the full body of the window, which is useful if 
      you ever want to break out of the frameset you have created and have a frameless 
      page. </li>
    <li>Using <b>"Parent Window</b> <b>(_parent)"</b> is similar to 
      Topmost window, but will refer to the immediate parent of a frame. In more 
      advanced frame usage there may be several nested frames and this allows 
      more control over which frames are specified. 
  </ul>
  <li> Click "OK". </li>
</ol>
