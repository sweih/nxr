<p class="wcopy"> Before you start using N/X Content Management System, make sure 
  that:</p>

<ul class="wcopy">
  <li>N/X CMS is installed and configured. For more information, see the Installation 
    guide. </li>
  <li>An editor user account is already available. </li>
  <li>The page <a href="help.php?topic=glossary#page_template">templates</a> 
    that you want to use have been designed and are available.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="wcopy">- <b>Tip 1</b>: When you create the templates, collaborate with other people 
  who are involved in the project. The developers, designers and editors should 
  all have their say. If you do this, your site <i>will </i>be better.<br>
  - <b>Tip 2</b>: Before you start to build your site, get your design team together 
  and draft the site structure on paper.<br>
