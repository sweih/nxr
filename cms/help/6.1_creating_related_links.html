<!-- This is where the actual help content begins. -->

<p class="wcopy">The pages on your site are typically accessible from a menu. To enchance the navigation experience further, you can create links that take the user directly from one page to another. This type of links are called <em>related links</em>.</p>

<p class="wcopy">To create links:</p>

<ol start="1" class="wcopy">
<li>From the <strong>Content</strong> menu, click the <strong>Website</strong> command.</li>

<p class="wcopy">The <strong>Browse sitemap</strong> area is displayed. On the site map you can see the pages currently on your site.</p>

<li>Click the page where you want to place the related link.</li>

<p class="wcopy">That page's properties are displayed on the right side of the screen.</p>

<li>Go to the <strong>Content</strong> tab and click the <strong>Create Instances</strong> button on the <strong>Related Links</strong> area.</li>

<li>Type the number of related links you want to create into the box and click the <strong>Create instances</strong> button.</li>

<p class="wcopy">A new related link instance is created. To create more instances, repeat the step.</p>

<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button on the instance you just created.</li>

<p class="wcopy">The related link instance is opened for editing. Fill in the following fields:</p>

<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top"><strong>Field</strong></td>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top"><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">Label</td>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">Text to be displayed on the link. Typically this is the title of the link's target page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">Internal Address</td>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">The page you want to link to. If you are creating a link within your site, select the target page from the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">External Address</td>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">Alternatively you can type a direct URL of the target page here. In this case leave the <strong>Internal Address</strong> box empty as this URL will override the internal address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top">Target</td>
	<td class="wcopy" valign="top"><p>The target attribute controls where the new page will be displayed when the user follows a link. Most of the time, clicking on a link simply loads a new page in the same window where the link was. However, with target, you can have the new page open in a new window, or if you are using frames, in another frame. You can target a frame by a name you have assigned it.</p>
<p>Target also has four predefined values, which can be used as if certain windows and frames already have names without you having to assign them:</p>
<ul type="disc" compact>
<li>_blank</li>
<li>_parent</li>
<li>_self</li>
<li>_top</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<li>Click the <strong>Save and Back</strong> button.</li>

</ol>

<p class="wcopy">A related link is now created on the page. To verify the result, launch the page and look at your development site before publishing the live site.</p>
