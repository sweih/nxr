<p> 
  <!-- This is where the actual help content begins. -->
</p>
<p class="wcopy">Metadata is information about the contents of the site. Some 
  metadata is written into the HTML code and other metadata might be visible as 
  alt-texts on images. You can add metadata for your page and the objects on your 
  page. </p>
<p class="wcopy">To edit META-data, choose <b>Content</b> in the main menu and 
  then <b>Website.</b></p>
<ol class="wcopy">
  <li>Choose the desired page you want to edit.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Edit META-Data</b> button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wcopy">Three fields are displayed: Description box, Keywords and User 
  profile. </p>
<ol class="wcopy">
  <li>Type in the Description field a short description of the content as you 
    would like to be displayed in search engine results.</li>
  <li>Type in the Keywords field information you find essential for your audience. 
    This information will also be used by search engines.</li>
  <li>Type in the Profile field the intended user of the page (an editor, a developer, 
    an administrator, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p class="wcopy">For example, if you are creating a page about a new product, 
  type in the Description box a short description of the product as you would 
  like it to be displayed in search engine results. In the Keywords box, indicate 
  the product's type, name and other features that you think are important. In 
  the User profile field, type in the intended user of the page.</p>
<p class="wcopy">You can add metadata (alt-text) for images while you are <a href="help.php?topic=3.2.2_adding_images">Adding 
  images</a> or when you already have an image in the Library. The alt-texts are 
  shown when the cursor is on the image.</p>
<ol start="1" class="wcopy">
  <li>To add metadata for images choose <b>Library</b> in the <b>Content</b> menu.</li>
  <p>The Content Library is displayed. The subfolders are displayed on the left-hand 
    side.</p>
  <li>Click <b>Fotos</b>. </li>
  <p>The contents of the <b>Fotos</b> -folder is displayed.</p>
  <p><b>Note</b>: You may also have images in the <b>Layout-Data</b> -folder.</p>
  <li>Click the <b>Edit</b> button next to the desired image.</li>
  <li>In the <b>ALT-Tag</b> field, insert the text you want to appear over the 
    image.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Save and back</b> button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wcopy">To add an alt-text to a text link, use the Internet text editor (such as FCKeditor). 
  In N/X, you can find this by clicking on the <b>Edit All</b> button in the <b>Edit 
  Content</b> menu. (<b>Browse Sitemap></b>page<b>>Edit Content>Edit 
  All</b>>Body)</p>
<p class="wcopy"><b>Note</b>: If you do not have an Internet text editor installed, 
  you must insert the html tag manually.</p>
