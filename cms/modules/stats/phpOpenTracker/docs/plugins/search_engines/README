SYNOPSIS

  This plugin stores information about what search engine was queried 
  for which keywords into a separate table. The phpOpenTracker API is 
  extended to provide statistical analysis on the most commonly used 
  search engine and / or the most commonly used keywords to find the 
  site tracked by phpOpenTracker.

INSTALLATION

  1.) Either copy the files from this distribution archive to
      the respective directories of your phpOpenTracker installation
      directory, or, and this is the prefered way, use the PEAR Installer

        pear install phpOpenTracker_Search_Engines_Plugin-X.X.X.tar.gz

      If you already installed a previous version of this plugin, you 
      may want to upgrade it with  

        pear upgrade phpOpenTracker_Search_Engines_Plugin-X.X.X.tar.gz

  2.) Create the pot_search_engines table in the database configured
      for use with phpOpenTracker.

  3.) Enable the plugin in your phpOpenTracker.ini file.

      If you don't have enabled any other plugins yet, change the line

        logging_engine_plugins = 

      to

        logging_engine_plugins = search_engines

      If you have already other plugins enabled, simply add

        ,search_engines

USAGE

  The data collected by this plugin can be accessed through the
  top_search_engines and top_search_keywords calls, that are
  added to the phpOpenTracker API:

    <?php
    require 'phpOpenTracker.php';

    $topSearchEngines = phpOpenTracker::get(
      array(
        'api_call' => 'search_engines',
        'what'     => 'top_search_engines',
        'range'    => 'total',
        'limit'    => 10
      )
    );

    $topSearchKeywords = phpOpenTracker::get(
      array(
        'api_call' => 'search_engines',
        'what'     => 'top_search_keywords',
        'range'    => 'total',
        'limit'    => 10
      )
    );

    $combinedStatistics = phpOpenTracker::get(
      array(
        'api_call' => 'search_engines',
        'what'     => 'combined_statistics',
        'range'    => 'total',
        'limit'    => 10
      )
    );

    print_r($topSearchEngines);
    print_r($topSearchKeywords);
    print_r($combinedStatistics);
    ?>
